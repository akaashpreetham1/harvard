# Harvard Student Representative Campaign Website Backend (Deployment) Planning

## Background and Motivation
The site is a static frontend hosted on GitHub Pages. "Backend" concerns are limited to deployment, build/minification steps, and optional third-party form handling (e.g., Formspree). No server-side code is required.

## Key Challenges and Analysis
- Static hosting on GitHub Pages from `main` branch root.
- Optional custom domain via `CNAME` and DNS configuration.
- Simple asset pipeline: image optimization to WebP, CSS minification, no bundler required.
- Optional contact form relies on external service; ensure privacy and spam protection.

## High-level Task Breakdown
1) Repository and Pages configuration
- Create repository, push initial code, enable Pages from `main`/root.
- Success: Site published at `https://<user>.github.io/<repo>/` or custom domain.

2) Optional custom domain setup
- Add `CNAME` file with domain, configure DNS (A/AAAA for apex via ALIAS/ANAME; CNAME for subdomain).
- Success: Domain resolves over HTTPS; Pages shows custom domain as verified.

3) Asset optimization workflow
- Convert images to WebP (and fallback JPEG/PNG if needed), document sizes.
- Minify CSS to `main.min.css` for production; keep `main.css` for development.
- Success: Lighthouse Performance â‰¥ 90 with optimized assets.

4) Optional contact form integration
- Configure Formspree endpoint; add client-side validation and honeypot field.
- Success: Test submissions received; validation and accessibility confirmed.

## Project Status Board
- [ ] Configure GitHub Pages for repository
- [ ] Optional custom domain with `CNAME`
- [ ] Image and CSS optimization workflow
- [ ] Optional contact form integration

## Current Status / Progress Tracking
Planning complete. Pending your confirmation on custom domain and contact form usage.

## Executor's Feedback or Assistance Requests
- Please confirm whether to use a custom domain and provide the domain name if yes.
- Confirm whether to include a contact form via Formspree; provide target email.

## Lessons
- Keep deployment simple: no build step required for Pages; pre-minify assets when ready.
- Ensure cache headers via file fingerprinting if assets change frequently (optional for this project).
